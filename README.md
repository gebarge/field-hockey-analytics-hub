# sports-analytics-hub

Welcome to my Sports Analytics repository! This serves as a central location for all my projects and explorations in the field of sports analytics. Here, you'll find a collection of data-driven analyses, visualizations, and models aimed at uncovering insights from sports data and enhancing performance metrics.

# Project Overview
The goal of this repository is to leverage sports data to draw meaningful insights and improve performance metrics. The analyses span various areas, from scouting reports to trends and regression models, all with a strong emphasis on using data effectively to inform decision-making.

# Sections

### UNC Metrics and Scouting
This section is dedicated to metrics and scouting insights specifically for UNC. It includes:

* Game Tendencies Document: A detailed document analyzing UNC's tendencies in the circle and shooting over the past four games. This analysis is particularly valuable for game preparation, offering insights leading up to key matchups.

### Overall Trends and Relationships
This part of the repository focuses on summarizing trends and correlations:

* Visualizations: A series of visual representations that highlight relationships and key determinants of success. The visualizations help make sense of overall patterns and how they translate into performance.

### Corner Analysis
The corner analysis section delves into our team's corner performance:

* Figures and Initial Thoughts: General statistics and insights derived from our corner attempts throughout the year.
Regression Analysis: A regression model that identifies factors contributing to our marginal success on corners. This analysis pinpoints the key elements that determine successful outcomes in corner situations.

# How to Use
Feel free to explore each section to gain insights or use the models provided for your analysis. All visualizations and documents are available for review, and you are welcome to contribute or suggest improvements.

# Future Work
1. Expanding the analysis to include more teams and datasets.
2. Enhancing models for greater predictive accuracy.
3. Incorporating real-time data updates for dynamic analysis.
